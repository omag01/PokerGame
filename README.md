# PokerGame
A simple GUI to represent a game of 5-card draw

Note: Depending on your IDE, you may need to change the path of the save file to the correct path (it is on the 20th line of PokerGame.java). It works for me in Eclipse now, but I can't be sure other editors use the same pathways for projects.
