# PokerGame
A simple GUI to represent a game of 5-card draw

Note: If you are getting file path issues, just know that it has to do with some annoying subtleties of the way I created this project. I switched midway through to a different editor that stored project directories differently, and now, it claims to not be able to find my saveFile. To fix this problem, just download all 5 raw files and place them in the exact same directory, then compile and run them.
